# jokeGenerator

Enroute Project #5

- A joke generator using XMLHttpRequests for an Chuck Norris Joke API (http://www.icndb.com/api/).

- Data saved using Firebase Realtime Database.

- Styled with Skeleton and Materialize.

- API endpoints were changed from HTTP to HTTPS because browswer was blocking unsecure non HTTPS GET call to an HTTP API endpoint.

## Known Issues

- Individual Delete Button not working.

- API does not accept a last name correctly. It defaults to "Norris" instead.
